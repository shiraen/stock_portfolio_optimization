# Stock Portfolio Optimization

This project is a Python implementation of mean-variance optimization. It uses historical stock prices to optimize a portfolio of stocks based on the user's preferences.

## Installation

This project was created and deployed using Jupyter notebook. To run the program on your computer, you need to have the following modules installed in your jupyter notebook: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, cvxopt, and plotly.

## Usage

1. Enter the name of your file that contains the monthly stock prices of you chosen companies in the "Stock Portfolio Analysis.ipynb" file.
2. Run the code in your jupyter notebook.
3. An interactive plot of the stocks on the efficient frontier will then be displayed. Hover on the points to see the expected return, volatility, and weights of each optimized stock portfolios.

Note: This is currently undergoing updates to make the code more readable and make graphs more interactive.
